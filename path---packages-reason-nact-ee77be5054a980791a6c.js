So why are we still programming like it\'s the 90s?</p>\n<p>Inspired by the approaches taken by Akka and Erlang, nact is an open source Node.js framework which enables you to take control of your state to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>more effectively use memory</li>\n<li>improve application resiliance</li>\n<li>increase performance</li>\n<li>reduce coupling </li>\n</ul>\n<p>With out of the box support for event sourcing, and a considered implementation of the actor model, nact can work across a wide variety of domains.</p>\n<p>Nact is no silver bullet, but it is evolving to tackle ever more demanding use cases. Perhaps one of them is yours?</p>\n<p>To get started, head to <a href="https://nact.io">https://nact.io</a></p>\n',homepageUrl:"https://github.com/ncthbrt/reason-nact#readme",repositoryUrl:"https://github.com/ncthbrt/reason-nact",npmUrl:"https://www.npmjs.com/package/reason-nact",issuesUrl:"http://github.com/ncthbrt/reason-nact/issues",slug:"packages/reason-nact"}},pathContext:{id:"reason-nact"}}}});
